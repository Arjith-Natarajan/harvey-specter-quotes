**harvey-specter-quotes** is a micro-library that can be used to generate quotes from [Suits Series](http://www.usanetwork.com/suits), spoken by Harvey. This package is an attempt to document the wisdom that is given to all, by the makers of Suits.


[**Harvey Specter**](http://suits.wikia.com/wiki/Harvey_Specter), is a cocky lawyer at a top New York Law Firm. Known as the 'best closer' in the city, he is one hell of a lawyer. He has built his career and life around one thing: *winning*. The Internet features his quotes in [discussions](https://www.reddit.com/r/suits/comments/66089l/did_harvey_specter_ever_actually_say_this_meme/),  [blogposts](https://www.scoopwhoop.com/Witty-One-Liners-By-Harvey-Specter-Suits/#.x30ij247i), [posters](https://in.pinterest.com/whatwouldharveydo/harvey-specter-quotes/?lp=true), and even in [memes](http://www.usanetwork.com/sites/usanetwork/files/styles/usanetwork_media_gallery_image/public/2016/01/ThisIsHarvey2.jpg?itok=mahTOVkL). Inspired by those, this library aims to record his quotes from the Show.
